  "TechnicianActor — the ISCO-08 3143 forestry technician actor as a
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).
  One graph run = one technical request (intake → propose → govern → decide → commit/hold,
  with a human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite internal loop;
  checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can resume after human sign-off.

  ```text
  :intake -> :propose -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit           (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval  (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold              (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the TechnicianProposer can never
  directly commit a record or dispatch an action the
  TechnicianGovernor refuses — every commit-record! call is gated
  behind `:decide`."
